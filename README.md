# Chat Search

Chat Search is a natural language search engine that uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model and the DuckDuckGo Search API to provide relevant search results to users.

## Features

- Natural language queries: Chat Search allows users to enter their search queries in the form of a question or statement, using natural language rather than specific keywords.
- Relevant results: Chat Search uses text-davinci-003 to select the most relevant results from the search results, ensuring that the user gets the information they are looking for.
- Responsive design: Chat Search is built using the Bootstrap framework, which makes it responsive and mobile-friendly.
